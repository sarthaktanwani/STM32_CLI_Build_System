# STM32 CLI Build system #

Inspired by [this](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLERTijJOmYrDiiWd10iRHY0VRHdJwUH4g) youtube playlist from fastbit academy, I'll be writing and maintaining minimalist code on all the STM32 microcontrollers that I have. I guess you can say that this is the baremetal version of software build system. I'll be using ARM's GCC compiler and GNU make for the project. This is a windows setup coz why don't we make our lives more difficult. This is just for my learning. I'll be pleasantly surprised if this turns out to be useful to someone in the future.
